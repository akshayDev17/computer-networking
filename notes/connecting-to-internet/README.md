# POTS and Dial-up<a name="pots"></a>



## Dial-up, Modems and Point-to-Point Protocols<a name="modems"></a>

1. Plain Old Telephone Service(POTS)
   1. inspiration of the first network architecture from public switched telephone network
   2. phone lines to transfer data
   3. USENET was developed
2. Dial-up connection
   1. uses POTS for data transfer
   2. connection is established by actually dialling a phone number
   3. <img src="images/dialup.png"/>
   4. Modem = MOdulator/DEModulator
      1. turn data understood by computer into audible wavelengths that can be transmitted over POTS
   5. earlier modems had *very low Baud rates*
      1. measurement of bits that can be passed across the phone line per second
      2. in earlier 1950s speed &approx; 110bps
   6. USENET - 300 bps
   7. when dial-up became a household commodity, early 1990s 14.4 kbps



# Broadband<a name="broadband"></a>

1. connections are long-lasting
   1. don't need to be established again and again after each use, unlike dial-up
   2. <img src="images/dial-up-pic.png" />
      this is for dial-up



## T-carrier technologies<a name="t-carrier"></a>

1. developed by AT&T in order to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link
2. require dedicated lines hence making them more expensive(cannot be general purpose in use), thus used majorly by businesses
